# About

This Project is a part of the Learn React series from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart)

## Structure

the src folder holds a few directories. `components`, `helpers`, `pages`, `store`, `assets` and `styles`. `components` is further divided into distinct directories that house specific component files relating to one another. The `styles` and `helpers` folder is structured the same as the `components` folder but houses css and js files. 
Environmental variables required for this project can be found in `.example.env`
